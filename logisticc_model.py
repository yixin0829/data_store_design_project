"""
In prepration of the development of a logistic model, I found a method called Tf-idf Vectoriztion to convert
text string data (comments) to numerical data. 

After that I can utilize sklearn library to train the model as long as I could fix the issue in data_collection.py
and acquire large amount of data

Since the detects hate speech I feel like the model should focus more on not only hatred words(e.g. "hate") but also
associate them with words related to race  color  national origin  sex  disability  religion  or sexual orientation

And when these two categories of words appear together in a comment there is high chance that this is a hate speech

Due to time limit I will leave it in here. 
Future development is possible.

Last, thank you again for preparing this exercise. It was a very pleasant experience.
