# data_store_design_project

## Problem Statement 
Design part of the sub-system for a data store of hate-speech-related content and allow social media platforms to match against this content.

## Notes (define terminologies)
- misinformation: information against reality dur to errors
- hate speech: public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation (Cambridge Dictionary)
- ground truth: desirable answer data for training your system (some may NOT be "true")
- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

## Research & Workflow
- Choose a sub-problem to focus
- Research state of the art
- Research tools needed
- Code

### Sub-problem to Solve & Assumption
- Data collection and preprocessing: how do we obtain high-quality data(string text in this case) and how do we filter out ambiguity 
- Design a classifier to determine which picece of information is hate speech ONLY
